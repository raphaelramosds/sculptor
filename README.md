<h1 align="center"> <b>Sculptor</b></h1>

## Project

A graphic interface that allows users draw into intersections planes in order to built three dimensional structures

> [Sculptor](https://github.com/raphaelramosds/sculptor-lib) is a Library developed by me for drawing sculptures with volume elements (voxels)

## Technologies

This desktop application was built with

- Qt framework
- C++

## Functionalities

Drawing modes can be switched by clicking on the left toolbar. There are four ones: voxel, box, sphere and ellipsoid. Once a mode is chosen, you can set the dimensions of the shape on the tab that will come up in the right side of the interface.

### Shortcuts

Put methods such as put voxel, put box, put ellipsoid and put sphere can be used with **left click**

Cut methods such as cut voxel, cut box, cut ellipsoid and cut sphere can be used with **right click**

`CTRL + N` creates a new sculpture

`CTRL + S` exports a OFF of the sculpture

`CTRL + Q` quit application

### New sculpture

You can reset your canvas by clicking on `Arquivo > Novo` and set the new dimensions of your canvas.

### Export your art!

Once you've finished your sculpture you may want to save it on a OFF file. It can be done on `Arquivo > Exportar` and select the directory you want to save it
